# Drinking Jenga
This repository contains the rules for Drinking Jenga, a variation of Jenga.

# Setup
- To set up Drinking Jenga, you require a set of Jenga blocks and a permanent marker.
- Number each Jenga block with a permanent marker from 1 to 54.

# Rules
Drinking Jenga plays the same way as normal Jenga, but as each block is drawn, a new rule is activated in accordance with the [**Rule List**](https://github.com/jaimeliew1/drinking-jenga/blob/master/rulelist.md). 

Note: These rules are a work in progress. Suggestions are welcome in the form of a pull request. Cheers!
